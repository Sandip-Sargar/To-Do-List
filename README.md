# To-Do-List
The **To-Do List Application** is a simple yet powerful task management tool that allows users to **add, edit, and delete tasks** while ensuring that all tasks are saved in **local storage** for persistence. This means that even after refreshing or closing the browser, tasks remain intact. The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a clean and responsive user interface. Users can quickly input new tasks, modify existing ones, and remove completed or unnecessary tasks. The implementation of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** ensures seamless task management, making it an efficient productivity tool. Additionally, the app requires no external database, as it leverages the **local storage feature** of modern web browsers. This makes it lightweight and easy to run on any platform, whether locally or hosted on **GitHub Pages** for public access. The project follows best practices in front-end development, making it a great learning resource for beginners while serving as a functional daily task organizer. ðŸš€
